# Custom breadcrumbs #

Breadcrumbs may be customized to place your site in it's "correct" hierarchy according to your organization, web server structure, etc. In "Template settings" you may add wikistyle links, one on each line, to build a custom 'crumb.

In the reverse case you may choose to hide some of your own hierarchy levels, e.g. if you are sharing an DokuWiki installation or just want to use a different (shorter perhaps?) text in the breadcrumbs.
