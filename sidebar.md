# Sidebars #

Sidebars are used much in the same way as menus, except a sidebare appears **only** on the page it is positioned beneath. The sidebar page is expected to be named `sidebar`.

A sidebar for `mypage` must be created at `mypage/sidebar`.

## Inherited sidebars ##

Sidebars may be inherited if you name the page `mainsidebar`. As with menus, it will be in use down through the hierarchy until it is replaced with a new `mainsidebar`.

## Sidebar syntax ##

Sidebars need no special syntax, but it you want to create an NTNU-style blue information box a special [Infoboks plugin](http://www.ime.ntnu.no/dokuwiki/plugin/infoboks) exists.

The page names `sidebar` and `mainsidebar` are configurable in the "Template settings" section.
